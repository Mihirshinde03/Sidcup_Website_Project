# Sidcup_Website_Project
Excited to share my latest achievement in front-end development! ðŸš€ 
Just completed my project â€“ A clone of the Sidcup Family golf website. 

Through this project, I've gained valuable hands-on experience in front-end development, 
utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even GSAP to create dynamic animations and interactions.
These languages and technologies have been the backbone of this project, 
and I'm excited to continue refining my skills and taking on new challenges.

Big shoutout to Sheryians Coding School for their incredible front-end development series.
I'm learning so much new things from it! ðŸ’¡
